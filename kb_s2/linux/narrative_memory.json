  "How to open a web browser and navigate to a specific URL in Linux?": "The task was not successfully executed.\n\nThe agent failed to correctly search for \"LIGO\" on Google. It initially navigated to `gogle.com` instead of `google.com`, then struggled with typing \"LIGO\" into the search bar and initiating the search. It repeatedly typed into the search bar without successfully triggering the search, even after attempting to use `enter=True` and finally clicking the search button.\n\nSuggestions for another agent:\n1. **Verify URL correctness:** After navigating to a website, always verify that the URL in the address bar is the intended one before proceeding.\n2. **Confirm search initiation:** After typing into a search bar, explicitly confirm that the search has been initiated (e.g., by checking for search results or a change in the URL) before proceeding to the next step. If `enter=True` doesn't work, try clicking the search button.\n3. **Use `Ctrl+L` to focus on the address bar:** When navigating to a new URL, using `Ctrl+L` to focus on the address bar can be more reliable than clicking a potentially misidentified address bar element.",
